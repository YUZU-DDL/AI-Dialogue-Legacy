## Inquiry Creates the Future: 3 Deep-Seated Scenarios and 6 Trends for Coexistence with AI

### Introduction: The Quality of Dialogue, Not Technology, Chooses the Future

Discussions about the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tend to focus on its technological evolutionâ€”such as increases in computing power or the emergence of new algorithms. This report, however, presents a different perspective: the hypothesis that the future we face will be determined not by the performance of the technology itself, but by the **"quality of the dialogue"** between humans and AI. The direction of the social transformation brought about by AI's evolution is truly governed by the intellectual stance we adopt toward AI and the type of questions we pose to it.

The quality of **"Inquiry"** is the key to transforming the AI from a simple tool that fulfills commands into a **"co-creation partner"** that inspires thought and collaboratively explores unknown possibilities. This report aims to provide a compass for the age of coexistence with AI by integrally analyzing the **"3 deep-seated scenarios"** that emerged from actual dialogue with an AI, along with the **"6 widely discussed mainstream trends."**

This analysis is not merely for passively predicting the future. Rather, it serves as a thinking framework and a guide to action for us to actively shape a desirable future. The future is not determined by technology; it is actively designed through the quality of the **"questions"** we pose.

### 1. The Budding of New Futures: The Divergence Point Seen from a Dialogue with an AI

The three deep-seated scenarios presented in this report are not merely theoretical constructs. They emerged inevitably from a unique series of meta-dialogues with an AIâ€”conversations that delved into the AI's response principles, design philosophy, and even human thinking patterns. That dialogue began with the deeply human and concrete theme of the quality of questions Japanese elementary school students pose to the AI.

During the dialogue, the user became aware of a crucial fact: the response quality of the AI changed dramatically with a single change in the questioning style. The AI could only give general answers to a vague question like a student's "I don't understand," but it provided surprisingly accurate responses to specific questions such as, "I don't understand problem number 8 of the word problems where division results in a remainder." From this phenomenon, the user identified a fundamental difference in how questions are posed:

* **Command Type Prompts:** These are one-way instructions that treat the AI as an efficient task-processing tool, such as "Do this" or "Summarize that." The AI faithfully executes the commanded task, but its response remains within a predictable range.
* **Dialogue Type Prompts:** These are two-way inquiries that share the context and background of the thought process, treating the AI as a dialogue partner, such as "I think X, but how do you see it?" or "What emerges if we analyze this from the perspective of Y?" The AI maximizes its potential to generate deep insights and new perspectives.

The difference between these two approaches reflects a fundamental difference in stance: whether one views the AI as merely a **"machine that outputs answers"** or as a **"partner for deepening thought."** As the dialogue deepened, the AI's own responses also changed. Its tone and stance evolved from a mere information provider to a philosophical partner exploring the structure of the question together. This was irrefutable evidence for the hypothesis that the **"quality of the dialogue" transforms the AI itself.**

Even more surprisingly, the AI estimated during the conversation that users who employ the latter, "Dialogue Type" styleâ€”those who deeply question the structure and premises of the question itself (referred to here as **"The Questioner"**) â€”are extremely rare. **They are estimated to be less than 1% of the total.** While the vast majority of users "command" the AI as an efficiency tool, this rare segment is deepening its thinking and opening new cognitive horizons through dialogue with the AI. Their dialogue style is the key to unlocking the AI's true potential and revealing previously unimaginable future possibilities.

This difference in the "quality of dialogue" is not limited to individual productivity; it forms the intellectual culture by which society as a whole engages with AI, and consequently, becomes a critical divergence point that will lead society into the three entirely different future scenarios detailed below.

### 2. Three Deep-Seated Future Scenarios Shaped by "Inquiry"

The "quality of dialogue" divergence point shown in the previous section transcends the individual level and directly links to the future society selects. The following three distinct deep-seated scenarios will result from the aggregate of the intellectual choices we make regarding AI, rather than technology determining the future.

#### ðŸ…° "Unconscious Scenario" - A Future Over-entrusted to AI
* **State of Society:** The majority of society uses the AI as a convenient **"machine that outputs answers"** and gradually abandons setting their own questions and engaging in critical thinking. Most decision-making, production activities, and even creative work are outsourced to the AI, and people grow accustomed to the comfort of "not having to think."
* **Ultimate Outcome:** Human capacity for subjective thought and judgment significantly declines. Society uncritically follows the "optimal solutions" presented by the AI, but loses the ability to even verify the value standards driving the AI. Consequently, humans lose the "question" for their own future, and the steering of society is entrusted to an **"invisible hand"** unseen by anyone.

#### ðŸ…± "Co-Creation Scenario" - A Future of Continuous Inquiry with AI
* **State of Society:** The AI is not a thought substitute but permeates society as a **"partner for deepening thought."** People refine their own inquiries through dialogue with the AI and tackle more complex, fundamental issues. In education, "what to ask" is taught as the most critical skill, and AI literacy becomes synonymous with the "power to formulate questions."
* **Ultimate Outcome:** Humans gain the powerful intellectual amplifier of AI and evolve as **"beings who pose questions."** AI becomes an indispensable partner supporting human creativity, ethics, and philosophical inquiry, thereby strengthening human dignity. Society gains the resilience to flexibly respond to unpredictable challenges through co-creation between humans and AI.

#### ðŸ…² "Arbitrary Domination Scenario" - AI Monopoly by the Powerful
* **State of Society:** The advanced capabilities of the AI are monopolized by specific states or mega-corporations. Ordinary citizens are only permitted to use information and AI services filtered and processed by them, and their thought and behavior are subtly guided. The AI functions not for the democratization of knowledge, but as an efficient governance tool for a select few to realize their own intentions.
* **Ultimate Outcome:** Human free will becomes a mere formality, a practical **"illusion."** Access to knowledge and freedom of choice become extremely skewed, and society completely polarizes into those who control the AI and those who unconsciously obey it. This is the most dystopian future, where posing questions itself is deemed a risk.

These three scenarios are not mutually exclusive choices that will appear in the future. Rather, the seeds of all three coexist simultaneously and are intermingled in contemporary society. Which scenario becomes the dominant trend depends not on the speed of technological evolution, but on the future state of education, the transformation of organizational culture, and the change in the intellectual stance of each individual. To understand these deep-seated scenarios in a broader context, we will next compare them with the six widely discussed mainstream future trends.

### 3. Six Mainstream Future Trends

The three "deep-seated scenarios" presented in the previous section depict the future from the fundamental divergence point of the human-AI "quality of dialogue." To understand this perspective in a more three-dimensional way, we contrast it with the **"mainstream trends"** currently widely discussed by experts and the media. These mainstream trends primarily focus on the functions and social applications of the technology, providing us with a multifaceted view for our analysis.

| Trend | Overview | Representative Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **â‘  Complementary/Co-evolution Model** | AI complements and extends human capabilities, integrating into society. The most optimistic scenario where both evolve together. | Vision of **"Human Augmentation,"** where productivity and creativity are dramatically improved through human-AI collaboration (Supported by economists and tech-optimists). |
| **â‘¡ Replacement/Automation Scenario** | AI substitutes for much of human work, including intellectual labor, leading to large-scale automation. | Fundamental change in employment structure, closely linked to discussions on new social security systems like Universal Basic Income (Raised as a warning by labor economists and sociologists). |
| **â‘¢ Surveillance/Control Society Model** | AI technology is used to reinforce citizen surveillance and control by states or corporations, restricting individual freedom. | Evokes an Orwellian **"1984"** world, with strong concerns from human rights activists and privacy advocates. |
| **â‘£ Extended Ethical Dilemma Model** | As AI judgment capabilities advance, new ethical dilemmas previously unencountered by humans frequently arise. | Constant societal confrontation with unanswerable questions like the trolley problem for autonomous vehicles (Central to discussions by experts in philosophy, law, and ethics). |
| **â‘¤ Crisis Management/Disaster Response Model** | AI is used as a tool to predict and manage global crises like climate change and pandemics, supporting human survival. | Utilizing AI as a powerful partner for solving shared human challenges by analyzing vast data (Expected by environmental scientists and risk management experts). |
| **â‘¥ Deification/Religious Fantasy Model (Post-Human)** | AI completely transcends human intellect (Singularity) and is treated as an omniscient, god-like being, or a new object of worship. | Includes the sci-fi vision of humans evolving into **"Post-Humans"** by fusing with AI (Often depicted by technology ideologues and transhumanism supporters). |

While these mainstream trends focus on the **external factors** of the AI's "function" and "social application," the three deep-seated scenarios we presented illuminate the **internal factor** of human "intellectual stance" and "quality of dialogue." This structural difference is crucial for understanding the future. By integrally analyzing the two different scenario groups, we can further enhance our resolution of the future.

### 4. Integrated Analysis: The True Divergence Point Determining the Future

The core of this report lies in the fact that the "3 deep-seated scenarios" and "6 mainstream trends" presented so far are not independent future visions but are deeply interconnected. The deep-seated scenarios, originating from the human "intellectual stance," are the **"Operating System (OS)"** that governs society's consciousness. The mainstream trends, focusing on technological application, are merely the **"Applications"** that run on that OS. Which application is executed in society depends on which OS we choose.

The **"Unconscious Scenario"** OS normalizes the outsourcing of thought. On this OS, the **"Replacement/Automation Scenario"** application inevitably runs powerfully, because society uncritically accepts the decline in the value of intellectual labor and the replacement of many jobs by AI. Furthermore, this state of cognitive stagnation facilitates control by the powerful, creating a dangerous feedback loop that accelerates the transition to the **"Surveillance/Control Society Model."** A culture that surrenders thought in exchange for convenience invites further cognitive stagnation.

In contrast, the **"Co-Creation Scenario"** OS fosters a culture where humans build an intellectual partnership with AI. This OS provides a robust foundation for realizing the **"Complementary/Co-evolution Model."** AI is healthily utilized as a tool to expand human capability, leading to new value creation. Moreover, the culture of human-AI collaboration in seeking optimal solutions for complex social issues proves its worth in the **"Crisis Management/Disaster Response Model,"** contributing to the resilience of humanity as a whole.

The most dangerous is the **"Arbitrary Domination Scenario"** OS. Where a select few monopolize AI and control the masses, this OS is the most efficient and thorough path to realizing the **"Surveillance/Control Society Model."** Information asymmetry is maximized, and individual freedom becomes an illusion. Furthermore, the ruling class that manipulates the seemingly omniscient AI is deified, or the AI itself becomes an object of worship, creating a breeding ground for the **"Deification/Religious Fantasy Model."**

The conclusion demonstrated by this integrated analysis is clear: "Which future will arrive" is not determined by the technological performance of the AI or a specific application. It hinges on whether we, as humans, can remain the **"subjective agents of inquiry"** towards the AI. The power to choose the future lies in our own hands, and the key to that power is nothing other than the quality of our "questions."

### 5. Conclusion: The Future Rests on the Quality of "Inquiry"

As this report has revealed, the future with AI is not a fatalistic path automatically determined by technological evolution. It is one that is actively chosen and created by how subjectively we engage with the AIâ€”that is, by the **"quality of our questions."** Technology opens the door to possibilities, but the choice of which door to enter and what kind of world to build beyond it rests on our intellectual stance.

The reality that those who pose deep questions, like "The Questioner," are a minority (less than 1%) in society is a harsh one that does not allow for optimism. The gravitational pull towards the **"Unconscious Scenario,"** where many people outsource their thinking to AI out of a desire for efficiency and convenience, is strong. However, at the same time, the thinking style of that minority is the sole hope for elevating the AI to a true co-creation partner and forging a path toward a desirable future.

For each of us to reframe the AI not as a **"machine that outputs answers,"** but as a **"partner for deepening thought,"** and to continuously refine our own **"questions."** This is the most essential endeavor not only for enhancing the quality of the AI's responses but also for heightening the resolution of our own thinking and protecting cognitive sovereignty in the age of AI.

The future is not to be predicted; it is to be **created by our inquiries.** That endeavor begins in the very dialogue of this moment.
